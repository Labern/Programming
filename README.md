# Programming

Programming is an exceptional powerful skill. I consider programming to be a skill, and the various programming languages you can use to be tools. However, many people think that programming takes years to learn. I don't believe this. Any programmer who is confident can pick up a new programming language in a matter of days, certainly enough to be able to make programs that do something useful. What people really mean when they say learning to program takes years is mastery. This, of course, is true. But learning to program to the extent that you are comfortable using the command line, learning new languages, and understanding the difference between them (including advantages and disadvantages[^1]), does not take that long. 

The goal of this essay is to teach you the basics of programming in one hour. Not mastery. But power. Enough power to be able to actually feel confident to go and take a course like CS50, build a website, or make a web app. 

Let's get to it, then.

## Assumptions about learning

I am going to assume that you have the ability to learn. I am going to assume that whatver your current level of comfort, you have picked up skills before, and, as a result, that you can pick up programming. I believe absolutely anyone can program. I also believe that the more confident you are in your abilities, the better you will be when you study. However, an important distinction: humility is actually the most powerful asset you can have when learning to program. By this I mean, when studying a language, assume that you know nothing, and go through the entire tutorial from start to finish. This is absolutely vital, because it does a number of things: it accomodates you to the teacher's style, it allows you to go over things you already know and enhance your knowledge of them through repetition, and will allow your current self to reflect on things your former self learnt. 

Trust me when I say being confident in your ability to learn, while at the same time showing humility in your approach to learning, will empower you to learn any skill.

## Footnotes 

Note on footnotes: they're the sign (in my opinion) of writing that is exceptionally well thought out. Any time you see a text with footnotes, it has all the signs of a powerful mind. 

[^1]: For example, the advantage of a programming language like C is that it is very fast, but a disadvantage is that simple things can take a lot of code to produce. In contrast, a programming language like Ruby or Python is very easy to use, but is slower. This is generally the tradeoff in programming languages: either a preference for speed and efficiency, or ease of use. It is precisely this kind of complexity which you learn over a long period of time. The actual programming skill itself is achieved much more quickly.
