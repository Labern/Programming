# Programming

In this essay, I will teach you to program.

Bold, I know, but that is the goal. **How?** First, by having faith in you, your ability to learn, your ability to become excited by your inspiration, and to create a febrile loop of "I wonder if... What if I made? ... If I can do this, then I can..." and so on. The more you know, the more you think about creating. The more you create, the more you know. And so on. And my goal is to get you to a place of being able to program, and think in terms of programming, as quickly as possible.

So: how can I possibly

The answer: by splitting programming into two elements: <code>**programming as a way of thinking**</code> and learning to use <code>**programming languages as tools**</code>. 

Programming is an exceptional powerful skill. I consider programming to be a skill, and the various programming languages you can use to be tools. However, many people think that programming takes years to learn. I don't believe this. Any programmer who is confident can pick up a new programming language in a matter of days, certainly enough to be able to make programs that do something useful. What people really mean when they say learning to program takes years is mastery. This, of course, is true. But learning to program to the extent that you are comfortable using the command line, learning new languages, and understanding the difference between them (including advantages and disadvantages[^1]), does not take that long. 

The goal of this essay is to teach you the basics of programming in one hour. Not mastery. But power. Enough power to be able to actually feel confident to go and take a course like CS50, build a website, or make a web app. 

Let's get to it, then.

## My assumptions about learning — and you

I am going to assume that you have the ability to learn. I am going to assume that whatver your current level of comfort, you have picked up skills before, and, as a result, that you can pick up programming. I believe absolutely anyone can program. I also believe that the more confident you are in your abilities, the better you will be when you study. However, an important distinction: humility is actually the most powerful asset you can have when learning to program. By this I mean, when studying a language, assume that you know nothing, and go through the entire tutorial from start to finish. This is absolutely vital, because it does a number of things: it accomodates you to the teacher's style, it allows you to go over things you already know and enhance your knowledge of them through repetition, and will allow your current self to reflect on things your former self learnt. 

Trust me when I say being confident in your ability to learn, while at the same time showing humility in your approach to learning, will empower you to learn any skill.

## The two aspects

I said that I would split programming into two elements. Here they are again, so you can familiarise yourself with them:

### Programming is the ability to
1. Think like a programmer, and
2. The ability to use programming languages.

Understanding this distinction allows you to very quickly find out what it is about programming you like, dislike, find easy, or difficult. In my opinion, learning the building blocks of a programming language is very easy. 

The far more difficult thing is learning to think like a programmer. The technical term for this is <code>**algorithmic thinking**</code>: that is, thinking in terms of algorithms. An algorithm is simply a set of instructions to be followed. Another way of stating this is that it is <code>**programmatic thinking**</code>. Whichever term you use, the idea is simple: as opposed to the way we think in most contexts, such as with metaphor, algorithmic thinking relies on a very strict way of thinking. Understanding this is crucial, because <code>thinking like a programmer is much harder than actually programming</code>.

Let me say that again: actually programming is easy. Ridiculously easy. You type some things, save a file, then type some more things (or click a button). That is easier than writing an essay in your native tongue. The really difficult thing, the thing that people actually find confusing, is finding a way to solve a problem using a programming language.

This means you can now think about programming differently. You learn to program by learning to think like a programmer, and then you learn to program by using specific tools. (I will avoid mentioning any languages for as long as possible, because I want to emphasise this point: programming is a way of thinking, and a programming language is simply a tool for expressing thoughts of that kind.)

Much of the problem with learning to program, from my experience, is that people do not distinguish between these two things. The beauty of knowing this is that you don't need to think "programming isn't for me": you can identify what aspect of programming you currently find difficult (either solving a problem or a specific detail of the language you are using), and then focus on solving that. You don't need to do it all at once.

In my opinion, far too many introductions to programming start talking about the various elements of a programming language ***without explaining what they are for*** or why. That is why understanding that programming languages are simply tools for expressing programmatic thinking is an absolutely essential pre-requisite to learning to program.

Once you know this, you can and will fall in love with programming — specifically, the things you can do.

## Where to start 

Now that we have this distinction — between thought and ability — we can approach the subject of learning to program in one of three ways. We can either 1. learn about how programs work first, 2. learn about the parts of a programming language, or 3. learn both at the same time. (The fourth logical option, to do neither, is not allowed. This is very much an <code>&&</code> situation — a reference you will understand by the end of this essay.)

So which way should we go?

The ideal option, I think, is to actually start learning the building blocks of a programming language in the knowledge that **there is a reason why they exist**. Then, once you actually know some specific pieces of a programming language, you will then learn how to use them to solve problems. In short, it's a little of both, but we will focus as much as possible on one aspect of programming as possible. The idea is that as you learn the parts of a programming language, instead of asking "what is the point of this?", you will be thinking "I wonder how this is going to be used..." Another distinction, but an important one. 

With that being said, let's move on to the juice.

# 1. Parts of a programming language 

Every programming language has something in common with every other programming language. This is because, like human languages, they have relationships. Some borrow (or inherit) ideas from other languages, while others rebel against things in others. At their core, however, they all do the same thing. It is this set of core things that programming languages do that will open the world of programming up to you.

Once you know the parts of a programming language, you will be able to learn any — and I mean any — programming language very quickly. And then you can actually decide which language you want to use based on how appropriate you think its approach to solving problems is. 

Now is when we will start to introduce terminology, but I hope that I have made it clear that all of this terminology is in service of solving problems. That is the goal: not to memorise, but to solve problems.

## 1.1 Programming languages (and people) love to talk

I don't mean "talk to the computer". I mean talk as in words. Specifically words and the individual characters that make up the words. 

This may surprise you, but you just learned one of the 5 most important parts of a programming language: programming languages have to deal with humans, and humans love to talk (and write). Dealing with words is the starting point in learning to programming.

## Footnotes 

Note on footnotes: they're the sign (in my opinion) of writing that is exceptionally well thought out. Any time you see a text with footnotes, it has all the signs of a powerful mind. 

[^1]: For example, the advantage of a programming language like C is that it is very fast, but a disadvantage is that simple things can take a lot of code to produce. In contrast, a programming language like Ruby or Python is very easy to use, but is slower. This is generally the tradeoff in programming languages: either a preference for speed and efficiency, or ease of use. It is precisely this kind of complexity which you learn over a long period of time. The actual programming skill itself is achieved much more quickly.
